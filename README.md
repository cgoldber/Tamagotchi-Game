# Tamagotchi-Game
Tamagotchis will be configured and controlled from the command line. Upon starting the program, the user will be prompted to list their name. From there, users will have the option to create a tamagotchi. When creating a tamagotchi, the user will input the name and type of the tamagotchi. The user cannot make duplicated names. The different types of tamagotchis to select from is: Cat, Dog, or Bunny.

Once a specific tamagotchi is selected, its lifecycle will be started and its meters will become live. Each tamagotchi has the following meters: Food Level, Happiness, Cleanliness, Energy, and Discipline. The meters are are out of 10, with levels 3-9 being “Normal”. A level of 10 = “High”, 2 = “Low”, and 0 = “Death.” When any meter reaches a level of 0, the tamagotchi will die. For the current tamagotchi being played, each meter will decrease by 1 notch every 1 minute. In order to raise their tamagotchis levels, the user can make commands for the tamagotchi.

The user will have the ability to switch between their tamagotchis if they created multiple. When the user switches from one tamagotchi to another, the new tamagotchi’s meters will become live and the previous tamagotchi’s meters pause. When a tamagotchi is selected, the user will have the opportunity to take care of their tamagotchi and keep track of their vitals. When the entire program is exited, all tamagotchi’s and their data will be erased.

When playing with a tamagotchi, there will be different commands that a user can call that will have different effects on the tamagotchi’s life. The user will also be able to play a minigame with their tamagotchi in order to raise their energy and happiness. It will be the users responsibility to ensure that all of a tamagotchis meters stay at a “Normal” state. Failing to do so may result in the death of a tamagotchi.

This project utilizes object-oriented programming and established design patterns. The UML diagrams provide visualizations of how the program works as the game is played.
